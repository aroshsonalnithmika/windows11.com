Our goal with the redesigned Photos app was to make it faster, easier, and more enjoyable for you to re-live and edit your photos on Windows 11! The redesigned Photos app includes the following changes and improvements for you to try out:

Beautiful new design: The Photos app has been redesigned to align with the new visual design of Windows 11. This includes rounded corners and Mica material across the app. The new visual design also includes updated typography styling (bolder) and new theme specific color palettes.</font></div></p>

<h2><p><div align="center">The beautiful new design of the Photos app on Windows 11 in dark mode.</div></p></h2>

<h2><p><div align="center"><font size="4">New photo viewing experience: You get gorgeous edge to edge views of your photos and all the tools you need to do basic photo editing via the updated toolbar. A new “filmstrip” now appears at the bottom of the photo viewer that shows all the items from a location and allows you to quickly jump around your photos directly within the viewer.</font></div></p></h2>
<h2><p><div align="center"><i>Windows 11 was built to unlock the full power of the PC. This new operating system empowers you to deliver new and innovative apps, grow your business how you choose, and makes developing on Windows easier by allowing you to use the tools and frameworks you already use and know. Windows 11 is our most open platform yet and it gives you the ability to build and run the widest range of apps.</i></div></p></h2>
